# Soloway's Recurring Rainfall Problem
This is the problem these two programs attempt to solve: https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Soloway%27s_recurring_rainfall
One does so functionally and the other has I/O capabilities. 
There are pros and cons to each of the approaches but mine in particular are single loop solutions that don't use functional decomposition.
Other solutions decompose for the sake of function clarity at the cost of performance which is also valid and is exemplary of good coding practices.
